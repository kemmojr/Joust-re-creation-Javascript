# 🕹 Joust-re-creation-Javascript  🦚 🦩 
## A personal re-creation of the classic arcade game Joust. Written in Pure JS + JS modules.
### Began as an early coding project back in high school 🏫

### Updating to have modern standards with skills learned from multiple years JS experience professionally and academically 👨‍💻

## 🎮 Future updates planned include:
- Continuing modularisation 📦
- Using css and HTML for the platform objects over manually drawing and applying fixed hitboxes
- Updating collision detection to avoid glitching through platforms ❌
-
