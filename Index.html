			<h2>The Aim of the Game</h2>
			<p>
				The aim of the game is to be the player with the highest score, achieved by eliminating the other player and gaining points in the process.
				You both start off on the bottom platform and maneuver your knight riding a flying bird to hit the other player and be higher up than they are, ending the exchange with you victorious!
			</p>
			<p>
				Jousts involve a collision between both players, and the game will check which player is the highest to award the winner.
				Challenge your friends to a duel to settle disputes once and for all. Happy Jousting!
			</p>
			
			<h2>Movement</h2>
			<p>
				Movement is key in Joust 2.0. The controls are simple:
			</p>
			<p><strong>Player 1 Controls:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Move left: A</li>
				<li>Move right: D</li>
				<li>Flap (To fly): R</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Player 2 Controls:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Move left: J</li>
				<li>Move right: L</li>
				<li>Flap (To fly): P</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Tips</h2>
			<p>
				Tips to improve your chances of winning:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Get the high ground:</strong> Holding the air above your enemy gives you an advantage. Start the battle with the high ground.</li>
				<li><strong>Move quickly:</strong> Once you have the high ground, move quickly across the screen. If you go off the edge, you end up on the other side.</li>
				<li><strong>Bounce along the top of the screen:</strong> This tactic can give you an edge over the competition. If you encounter another player doing the same, it might help, but it's somewhat luck-based.</li>
